# ProHub
PROductivity HUB is a productivity app that is targeted at students to provide them with the motivation needed to get things done,
and it consists of key features that almost any student will commonly use. 

What sets our application apart from current productivity apps is that we will encourage users to use our productivity features which will grant them coins. 
We will then have a leaderboard which will allow them to see the progress of their friends and in turn measure their productivity against their friends.

  Upon logging in, the user is brought to the Leaderboard page. Users can earn experience points by completing daily tasks in the todo list or by using the focus timer. These points then contribute to the userâ€™s level. The experience points requirement increases every 10 levels to make it progressively harder to level up.
  This encourages each user to work harder to gain more experience points to level up in order to beat their friends and be at the top of the leaderboard, thereby providing the motivation to increase their productivity.
